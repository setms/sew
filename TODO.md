# Things to do

## Table of contents

- [Domain story](#domain-story)
- [Use case](#use-case)


## Domain story

- Rendering: re-use work objects at end of sentences
- Conversion to use case scenario: handle multiple activities in single sentence


## Use case

- Do we still need to describe steps now that we have domain stories?
  - If so, then fix the cases where description doesn't currently work
