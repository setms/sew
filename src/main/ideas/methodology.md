# Methodology

The basic idea behind the methodology is that a software development project starts with basic artifacts that
capture the requirements, and then the tooling generates further artifacts and suggests next steps.
At various points in the development lifecycle, there will be more than one possible next step.
Also, multiple iterations through the lifecycle may happen concurrently.
