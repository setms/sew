# Knowledge work

Knowledge work can be differentiated from other forms of work by its emphasis on "non-routine" problem-solving that
requires a combination of convergent and divergent thinking.
There are various definitions, with the most narrow being

> the direct manipulation of symbols to create an original knowledge product, or to add obvious value to an existing one

Knowledge workers spend a portion of their time searching for information.

Most knowledge workers prefer some level of autonomy, and do not like being overseen or managed.

This type of work includes a complex combination of skill sets or _creative knowledge work (ckw) capacities_.
Creative knowledge workers use a combination of creative applications to perform their functions/roles in the knowledge
economy, including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic
sensibilities.

The two modes of working ranged from individual to collaborative where a worker might be doing either or both depending 
on the specific activity.

Typical knowledge workers (especially R&D scientists and engineers) in the age of knowledge economy must have some
system at their disposal to create, process and enhance their own knowledge.
The practice of knowledge management, or "KM" evolved in the 1990s to support knowledge workers with standard tools and
processes.

Knowledge workers engage in peer-to-peer knowledge sharing across organizational and company boundaries, forming
networks of expertise.

Palmer notes that effective and efficient knowledge work relies on the smooth navigation of unstructured processes and
the elaboration of custom and one-off procedures.
He points to the emergence of Adaptive Case Management (ACM).
ACM refers to the coordination of a service request in finance, health, legal, citizen, or human resources-related
matters, on behalf of a subject such as a customer, a citizen, or an employee.
The tasks required by a case usually involve creating a case folder or container for all required artifacts.
Case management is highly collaborative, dynamic, and contextual in nature, with events driving a long-lived case-based
business process.

Knowledge workers bring benefits to organizations in a variety of ways. These include:

- analyzing data to establish relationships
- assessing input to evaluate complex or conflicting priorities
- identifying and understanding trends
- making connections
- understanding cause and effect
- ability to brainstorm, thinking broadly (divergent thinking)
- ability to drill down, creating more focus (convergent thinking)
- producing a new capability
- creating or modifying a strategy

The theory of Human Interaction Management asserts the following principles characterizing effective knowledge work:

- Build effective teams
- Communicate in a structured way
- Create, share and maintain knowledge
- Align your time with strategic goals
- Negotiate next steps as you work

Knowledge Management (KM) needs to convert internalized tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge to share it.
One strategy to KM involves actively managing knowledge (push strategy). In such an instance, individuals strive to
explicitly encode their knowledge into a shared knowledge repository, such as a database, as well as retrieving
knowledge they need that other individuals have provided (codification).
Codification strategy is document-centered strategy, where knowledge is mainly codified as "people-to-document" method.
Codification relies on information infrastructure, where explicit knowledge is carefully codified and stored.

- Collaborative software (Groupware) is software that facilitates collaboration and sharing of organizational information.
- Workflow systems allow the representation of processes associated with the creation, use and maintenance of
  organizational knowledge, such as the process of creating and using forms and documents.
